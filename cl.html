<p>The third position of the best anime list may satisfy many Japanese anime fans, however, some foreign people may be surprised at it since Clannad (クラナド) is less known worldwide. Clannad is one of the Kyoto Animation’s masterpieces, which is recommended for any kind of anime fan. There is no action scene or supernatural event in this anime, but human drama is represented sensitively.<br>

There are two parts in the anime: Clannad in 2007-2008 and Clannad After Story in 2008-2009. The story follows the daily life of the main character Tomoya and the heroine Nagisa in the high school. It reaches the climax in the second half of the anime, and touching episodes move you. It is totally worth spending the amount of time for 44 main episodes.</p>

Air Dates: 2007-2009<br>
Genre: Drama, Slice of life<br>
